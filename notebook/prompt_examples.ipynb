When the machine is switched off, more hot water  \\ncan be dispensed. See also chapter 6. 5 Dispensing of hot water.  \\n Important!  \\nThe PID -control assists the machine in keeping a constant boiler temperature. This means  \\nthat the machine is heated continuously and that the orange control lamp blinks every  \\nsecond. The boiler temperature is indicated on the PID-display.  \\n6. USE OF THE MACHINE  \\n6.1 Prepar ation of the machine  \\nThe switched off machine is to be  placed  into operation as follows:  \\n1. Make sure that there is sufficient water in the water tank.  Refill water if necessary.  \\n2. Make sure that the switches pump/hot water and steam are in  the lower position, the power switch is in \\nlower position  and the steam/ hot water valve is closed.  \\n3. If the boiler temperature is below 40°C when the machine is switched on, the display will show \\\"UP\\\" and \\nthe machine  will start in Fast Heat Up mode.  \\n4. The heating period depends on the ambient temperature and is approx. 10 minutes. The indicator of the \\npump pressure gauge may move slightly during the heating -up phase.  \\n5. The Classika PID  is heated up as soon as the desired preset temperature appears on the PID display or \\nthe display shows FLU.  While 'FLU' is shown on the display, the user should perform a flush until 'rdY/Go' \\nis shown on the display. To do this, keep the portafilter clamp ed and place a tall cup under the portafilter \\nspout.  \\n6. When the message 'rdY/Go' appears, the machine is ready to brew the first cup of coffee.  \\n7.

After brewing the coffee, activate the steam switch by moving it into the upper position to start steam dispensing for frothing the milk. Ensure the steam nozzle is kept underneath the surface of the milk to avoid sprayings and injuries, and do not bring the milk to a boil for successful frothing.\\nSOURCES: https://www.ecm.de/fileadmin/manual/BA-Classika_PID-2023-08-web.pdf\\n\\nQUESTION: What should you do if the remote control does not work?\\n=========\\nContent: •Remov\\ne and reconnect all cables connected to the TV and the external devices.
